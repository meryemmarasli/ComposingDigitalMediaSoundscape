# Soundscape
This soundscape is meant to depict someone running away from something or someeone. There are a lot of different elements to it from the persons running footsteps to the cars on the street in the background. I wanted this soundscape to sound eerie and a little scary. Towards the end of the soundscape, I want to include music elements. That will hopefully tie everything together.
