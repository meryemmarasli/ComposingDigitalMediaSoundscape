# Soundscape
Originally, I wanted to take my soundscape in a completely different direction. I wanted to create something that showed what it felt like being trapped between two different cultures as a child of immigrants.  Once I started, I realized that I would not be able to execute the original vision that I had due to lack of technical skills. So, I decided to switch gears and create something more simple where I can practice using the software.
The purpose of this soundscape is to depict a character running away from someone or something. The soundscape starts with running,  heavy breathing, and background noise that consists of owls and cars. Next, a crash occurs  and someone yells at the character.  After some time passes, the character tries to get into their apartment, some music plays in the background from the character's neighbors apartment, the character walks up the steps, enters their apartment and relaxes on their bed. 
To properly execute my soundscape, I created a draft listing specific things that I wanted to include in the audio. If those specific things had specific effects, I made sure to make a note of it in the draft as well. Then,  I created a mini script that listed the chronological order of how I want the overall soundscape to play out.  After I created a draft, I started to actually build the soundscape. The way I approached this was by just adding the tracks in chronological order and making sure that the portion I am working on sounds like the final product before moving forward. Some effects that I included in the audio were the amplify, low-pass filter, change pitch, bass and treble, change speed, and fade out. The screenshots I included highlights some of these effects.  After the entire audio was compiled, I went through it again to make sure I did not miss anything. The soundscape is just over 2 minutes. To make sure the purpose of the audio was conveyed, I also asked a few people to listen to it and asked them what it sounded like.
